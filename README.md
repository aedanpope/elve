# Python Learning Platform

An interactive Python learning platform designed for classroom use with structured worksheets. Students can write and run Python code directly in their browser using Pyodide (Python compiled to WebAssembly).

## Features

- **Interactive Worksheets**: Structured learning with 5-6 problems per worksheet
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Problems start easy and get progressively harder
- **Real-time Code Execution**: Run Python code instantly in the browser
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators and completion tracking
- **Hints System**: Helpful hints for each problem
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **No Installation Required**: Runs entirely in the browser

## Worksheet Structure

Each worksheet contains:
- **Instruction Problems**: Introduce new concepts with examples
- **Practice Problems**: Reinforce learning with guided exercises
- **Challenge Problems**: Apply knowledge to more complex scenarios
- **Points System**: Gamified learning with point-based scoring
- **Estimated Time**: Help teachers plan classroom activities

## Current Worksheets

1. **Worksheet 1: Getting Started with Print** - Learn the basics of Python's print function
2. **Worksheet 2: Variables and Basic Math** - Introduction to variables and arithmetic
3. **Worksheet 3: Getting User Input** - Interactive programs with user input

## For Teachers

### Creating New Worksheets

1. Copy the template file: `worksheets/template.json`
2. Rename it to `worksheet-X.json` (where X is the next number)
3. Fill in the worksheet content following the template structure
4. Update `worksheets/index.json` to include your new worksheet
5. Deploy the updated files

### Worksheet Data Structure

```json
{
  "id": "worksheet-id",
  "title": "Worksheet Title",
