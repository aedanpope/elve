## About Wavelet Zone

Wavelet Zone provides a comprehensive Python learning experience through interactive worksheets and real-time code execution. Our platform makes learning Python accessible, engaging, and effective for students of all skill levels.

## Key Features

- **Worksheet-Based Learning**: 5 structured worksheets with ~20 problems each across three difficulty levels
- **Numerical Programming Foundation**: Worksheets 1-4 focus on core programming concepts without string complexity
- **Interactive Code Execution**: Run Python code instantly in the browser using Pyodide
- **Visual Input System**: User-friendly textbox inputs instead of intimidating command line prompts
- **Real-time Validation**: Immediate feedback with educational error messages
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators and completion tracking
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## Educational Approach

The Wavelet Zone platform addresses key limitations of traditional programming courses:
- **Multiple Practice Opportunities**: Unlike single-concept repetition
- **Non-Linear Learning**: Students can work on different difficulty levels within the same worksheet
- **Always Accessible**: Students always have problems they can solve, preventing frustration
- **Immediate Results**: Students always run working code, never spend entire lessons stuck

## Learning Progression

The Wavelet Zone curriculum follows a carefully designed progression where Worksheets 1-4 focus exclusively on numerical programming without string complexity, allowing students to build solid fundamentals while creating engaging interactive programs. Only after mastering core concepts do students encounter strings in Worksheet 5, introduced in a simplified manner that avoids common pitfalls and unnecessary complexity.

For detailed descriptions of each worksheet, see [WORKSHEETS.md](WORKSHEETS.md).
